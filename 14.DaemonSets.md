# Deamon Sets

### In cases when we need to collect monitoring data from all nodes, or to run a storage daemon on all nodes, then we need a specific type of Pod running on all nodes at all times. A DaemonSet is the object that allows us to do just that. It is a critical controller API resource for multi-node Kubernetes clusters. The kube-proxy agent running as a Pod on every single node in the cluster is managed by a DaemonSet. Whenever a node is added to the cluster, a Pod from a given DaemonSet is automatically created on it. Although it ensures an automated process, the DaemonSet's Pods are placed on nodes by the cluster's default Scheduler. When the node dies or it is removed from the cluster, the respective Pods are garbage collected. If a DaemonSet is deleted, all Pods it created are deleted as well. A newer feature of the DaemonSet resource allows for its Pods to be scheduled only on specific nodes by configuring nodeSelectors and node affinity rules. Similar to Deployment resources, DaemonSets support rolling updates and rollbacks.
