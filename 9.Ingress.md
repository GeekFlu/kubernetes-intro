# With Ingress, users do not connect directly to a Service. Users reach the Ingress endpoint, and, from there, the request is forwarded to the desired Service. You can see an example of a sample Ingress definition below:
```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: virtual-host-ingress
  namespace: default
spec:
  rules:
  - host: blue.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          service:
            name: webserver-blue-svc
            port:
              number: 80
        path: /
        pathType: ImplementationSpecific
  - host: green.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          service:
            name: webserver-green-svc
            port:
              number: 80
        path: /
        pathType: ImplementationSpecific
```
## In the example above, user requests to both blue.example.com and green.example.com would go to the same Ingress endpoint, and, from there, they would be forwarded to webserver-blue-svc, and webserver-green-svc, respectively. This is an example of a Name-Based Virtual Hosting Ingress rule.

## We can also define Fanout Ingress rules, when requests to example.com/blue and example.com/green would be forwarded to webserver-blue-svc and webserver-green-svc, respectively:
```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: fan-out-ingress
  namespace: default
spec:
  rules:
  - host: example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /blue
        backend:
          service:
            name: webserver-blue-svc
            port:
              number: 80
        pathType: ImplementationSpecific
      - path: /green
        backend:
          service:
            name: webserver-green-svc
            port:
              number: 80
        pathType: ImplementationSpecific
```
