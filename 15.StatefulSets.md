# StatefulSets

- The [StatefulSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/) controller is used for stateful applications which require a unique identity, such as name, network identifications, or strict ordering. For example, MySQL cluster, etcd cluster. The StatefulSet controller provides identity and guaranteed ordering of deployment and scaling to Pods. Similar to Deployments, StatefulSets use ReplicaSets as intermediary Pod controllers and support rolling updates and rollbacks.
