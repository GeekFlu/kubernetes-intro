# Service Mesh
- Service Mesh is a third party solution to the Kubernetes native application connectivity and exposure achieved with Services paired with Ingress Controllers. Service Mesh tools are gaining popularity especially with larger organizations managing larger, dynamic Kubernetes clusters. These third party solutions introduce features such as service discovery, multi-cloud routing, and traffic telemetry. 

- A Service Mesh is an implementation that relies on a proxy component part of the Data Plane, which is then managed through a Control Plane. The Control Plane runs agents responsible for the service discovery, telemetry, load balancing, network policy, and gateway. The Data Plane proxy component is typically injected into Pods, and it is responsible for handling all Pod-to-Pod communication, while maintaining a constant communication with the Control Plane of the Service Mesh.

- Several implementations of Service Mesh are:

* [Consul](https://www.consul.io/) by [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/)
* [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) built by Lyft, currently a [CNCF project](https://www.cncf.io/) 
* [Istio](https://istio.io/) is one of the most popular service mesh solutions, backed by Google, IBM and Lyft
* [Kuma](https://kuma.io/) by [Kong](https://konghq.com/)
* [Linkerd](https://linkerd.io/) a [CNCF project](https://www.cncf.io/)
