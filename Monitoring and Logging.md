# Monitoring and Logging

In Kubernetes, we have to collect resource usage data by Pods, Services, nodes, etc., to understand the overall resource consumption and to make decisions for scaling a given application. Two popular Kubernetes monitoring solutions are the Kubernetes Metrics Server and Prometheus. 

* [Metrics Server](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/resource-metrics-pipeline/#metrics-server) :Metrics Server is a cluster-wide aggregator of resource usage data - a relatively new feature in Kubernetes.
* [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/): Prometheus, now part of CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation), can also be used to scrape the resource usage from different Kubernetes components and objects. Using its client libraries, we can also instrument the code of our application. 
* Another important aspect for troubleshooting and debugging is Logging, in which we collect the logs from different components of a given system. In Kubernetes, we can collect logs from different cluster components, objects, nodes, etc. Unfortunately, however, Kubernetes does not provide cluster-wide logging by default, therefore third party tools are required to centralize and aggregate cluster logs. A popular method to collect logs is using [Elasticsearch](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/logging-elasticsearch-kibana/) together with [fluentd](https://www.fluentd.org/) with custom configuration as an agent on the nodes. fluentd is an open source data collector, which is also part of CNCF.
