# K8's Community

-  With over [70K GitHub stars](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/), Kubernetes is one of the most popular open source projects. The community members not only help with the source code, but they also help with sharing the knowledge. The community engages in both online and offline activities.

Currently, there is a project called K8s Port, which recognizes and rewards community members for their contributions to Kubernetes. This contribution can be in the form of code, attending and speaking at meetups, answering questions on Stack Overflow, etc.

Next, we will review some of the mediums used by the Kubernetes community.

## Slack Channels
Community members are very active on the [Kubernetes Slack](https://kubernetes.slack.com/). There are different channels based on topics, and anyone can join and participate in the discussions. You can discuss with the Kubernetes team on the #kubernetes-users channel. 

Mailing Lists
There are Kubernetes users and developers mailing lists, which can be joined by anybody interested.
