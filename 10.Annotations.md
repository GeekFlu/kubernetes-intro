# Annotations

## Unlike Labels, annotations are not used to identify and select objects. Annotations can be used to:
* Store build/release IDs, PR numbers, git branch, etc.
* Phone/pager numbers of people responsible, or directory entries specifying where such information can be found.
* Pointers to logging, monitoring, analytics, audit repositories, debugging tools, etc.
* Ingress controller information.
* Deployment state and revision information.

## For example, while creating a Deployment, we can add a description as seen below:
```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: webserver
  annotations:
    description: Deployment based PoC dates 2nd May'2019
```

### Annotations are displayed while describing an object:
- kubectl describe deployment webserver
```
Name:                webserver
Namespace:           default
CreationTimestamp:   Fri, 02 Oct 2020 05:10:38 +0530
Labels:              app=webserver
Annotations:         deployment.kubernetes.io/revision=1
                      description=Deployment based PoC dates 2nd May'2019
```
